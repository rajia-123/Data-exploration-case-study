# Python Data Exploration and Visualization Case Study

This repository contains a comprehensive case study on data exploration and visualization using Python. The project demonstrates various techniques of the pandas and matplotlib libraries that are essential for answering business or interview questions related to data exploration. This will help you understand both basic and advanced topics related to data manipulation in Python.

## Project Overview

In this case study, we cover the following key areas:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: How to import data from various sources and handle missing or incorrect values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Techniques to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using pandas to filter, sort, and transform data.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots using matplotlib to visualize data trends and insights.
- **Pivot Tables**: Creating and manipulating pivot tables to summarize data.
- **Filtering and Querying**: Techniques to filter data to answer specific questions.

## Features

- **Table Creation**: Learn how to create tables from the main data source.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize entire or custom tables using various plotting techniques.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter data to answer specific business questions.
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to summarize and analyze data.
- **Sorting Data**: Sort data based on different criteria to identify trends.

## Usage

To explore this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-exploration-case-study.git

## Conclusion
This case study provides a detailed walkthrough of data exploration and visualization techniques using Python. It is a valuable resource for data scientists and analysts looking to enhance their data manipulation skills.


## Example

Here's a brief example of how to load and explore the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('parking.xls - data_gov_bldg_rexus.csv')

# Display basic information about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Plot a histogram of a specific column
data['column_name'].hist()
plt.show()
